# Script Plugin Hieroglyphs.io

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This program allows me to transform a static SVG image into a javascript function allowing it to be dynamically editable.   

## Description  

For my project X I had to simplify the creation process as much as possible. This program allows me to transform my SVG creations into a Javascript function that can easily be modified by the user using my npm plugin. This is a python program that retrieves SVG image data and integrates it into a javascript function by adding customizable elements and dimensions that can easily be integrated into a project.
